# RecordFilter
In this project, I utilize Ajax with Jquery to filter a list without reloading the page. I built this project to showcase my ability to make Ajax calls to a server and return
records in the proper JSON format as well as working with datetime and pytz. If I were to continue this project, I would build out a login authentication for admin users, and give
them the ability to add new records. And perhaps a dashboard for them to see who they've created. 

Technologies/tools Used:
  1. Python
  2. Javascript(Jquery)
  3. Ajax
  4. Django
  5. Bootstrap
  6. FontAwesome
  
Instructions:

1. Type a first name to filter the list by first name(I didn't do the same for last name simple because of redundancy, although this would be easy to add.)
2. Fill out both the from and to date fields to filter the list by date. (Note: If I continued on this project, I would make each date selection convert to the datetime for the
end of that day. As it is currently, selecting 9/3 will not show any records created after 12am on 9/3.)
3. Type a name that doesn't exist to see the table display "No record found".
